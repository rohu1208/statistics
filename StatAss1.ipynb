    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF: The PMF is a function that assigns a probability to each possible value of a discrete random variable. It is denoted by P(x) and satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 ≤ P(x) ≤ 1 for all x\n",
    "∑P(x) = 1, where the sum is taken over all possible values of x\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the outcome X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6, P(X = 2) = 1/6,..., P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF: The PDF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It is denoted by f(x) and satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) ≥ 0 for all x\n",
    "∫f(x)dx = 1, where the integral is taken over all possible values of x\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a random variable X that follows a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The PDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = 1, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 f(x) = 0, otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that describes the cumulative probability of a random variable up to a certain point. It is denoted by F(x) and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = P(X ≤ x)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used to find the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a random variable X that follows a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The CDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = x, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 F(x) = 0, for x < 0 F(x) = 1, for x > 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used to find the probability that a random variable takes on a value within a certain range. For example, to find the probability that X is less than or equal to 0.5, we can use the CDF: P(X ≤ 0.5) = F(0.5) = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is commonly used to model real-valued random variables that are expected to be distributed symmetrically around a central value. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Human heights and weights\n",
    "IQ scores\n",
    "Errors in measurement\n",
    "Stock prices\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean determines the location of the distribution, while the standard deviation determines the spread of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small standard deviation indicates a narrow distribution, while a large standard deviation indicates a wide distribution.\n",
    "A mean of 0 indicates a symmetric distribution around 0, while a non-zero mean indicates a shifted distribution.\n",
    "Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is important because it is a common and useful model for many real-valued random variables. It is widely used in statistics, engineering, economics, and other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has several important properties that make it useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is symmetric and bell-shaped, which makes it easy to work with.\n",
    "It is continuous, which makes it suitable for modeling continuous variables.\n",
    "It is widely applicable, as many real-valued random variables follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "Real-life examples of normal distribution include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Human heights and weights\n",
    "IQ scores\n",
    "Errors in measurement\n",
    "Stock prices\n",
    "Blood pressure readings\n",
    "Exam scores\n",
    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the outcome of a single trial with two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0). It is characterized by a single parameter p, which is the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we flip a coin and want to model the outcome (heads or tails). The Bernoulli distribution can be used to model this outcome, with p = 0.5 (assuming a fair coin).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the binomial distribution is the number of trials:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Bernoulli distribution models a single trial with two possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution models multiple trials (n) with two possible outcomes, and the probability of success (p) is the same for each trial.\n",
    "Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability, we can use the z-score formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where x = 60, μ = 50, and σ = 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that P(Z > 1) = 0.1587.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is approximately 0.1587 or 15.87%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models a random variable that can take on any value within a certain range or interval. The probability density function (PDF) of the uniform distribution is constant over the range, and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a random variable X that represents the time (in hours) it takes for a customer to arrive at a store. We assume that the time is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = 1/2, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 f(x) = 0, otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = x/2, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 F(x) = 0, for x < 0 F(x) = 1, for x > 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: What is the z score? State the importance of the z score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean of a normal distribution. It is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the observation, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of the z-score lies in its ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardize values from different distributions, allowing for comparison and analysis.\n",
    "Identify outliers and anomalies in a dataset.\n",
    "Calculate probabilities and percentiles using standard normal distribution tables or calculators.\n",
    "Perform hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction.\n",
    "Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability theory that states that, given certain conditions, the distribution of the mean of a large sample of independent and identically distributed random variables will be approximately normal, even if the underlying distribution is not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the CLT lies in its far-reaching implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a theoretical basis for many statistical methods and techniques, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "It allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data.\n",
    "It provides a way to approximate complex distributions using the normal distribution.\n",
    "It has numerous applications in fields such as engineering, economics, and medicine.\n",
    "Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",
    "The random variables have a finite mean and variance.\n",
    "The sample size is sufficiently large (typically n > 30).\n",
    "These assumptions ensure that the CLT can be applied to a wide range of distributions, and that the resulting normal approximation is accurate.\n",
